HR = """

Below is a list of **subdomains** (topics) within the **Human Resources (HR)** domain where **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can be applied, focusing on new use cases that leverage LLMs' capabilities in natural language understanding, generation, and task automation to enhance HR processes, employee engagement, and organizational efficiency. This domain is distinct from previously discussed areas (e.g., Project Management, Corporate Governance, Supply Chain, etc.), ensuring no overlap with prior use cases (e.g., HR process automation in Business Process Automation or governance training in Corporate Governance). Each subdomain highlights practical applications where LLMs, integrated with agentic frameworks or tools, connect to HR systems (e.g., Workday, BambooHR) or communication platforms to streamline tasks and provide insights. As requested, I’ll avoid referencing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) unless explicitly needed and align with your interest in agentic frameworks and real-world applications. Since you’ve shifted focus to LLMs, I’ll emphasize their role in processing natural language, automating workflows, and generating content, without relying on MCP-specific integrations unless relevant.
